    "question": "How has Netflix's (NASDAQ: NFLX) Average Revenue Per Paying User Changed from 2019 to 2024?",
    "answer": "FINAL ANSWER: Netflix's global Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), which Netflix calls ARM (Average Revenue per Membership), changed as follows from 2019 to 2024:\n\n2019: ~$10.82 per month\n2020: ~$10.91 per month (+ $0.09 or +0.8% YoY)\n2021: ~$11.67-11.76 per month (estimated, +7-8% YoY)\n2022: ~$11.67-11.76 per month (estimated, relatively flat)\n2023: $11.64 per month (relatively flat)\n2024: $11.70 per month (+ $0.06 or +0.5% YoY)\n\nOverall Trend: Netflix's ARPU increased approximately 8% from 2019 to 2024 (from $10.82 to $11.70), with the most significant growth occurring between 2020 and 2021 (likely driven by pandemic demand and price increases). From 2021-2024, ARPU remained relatively stable in the $11.64-$11.76 range. \n\nNote: Netflix announced in 2024 that it would stop regularly reporting ARM as a standalone metric, focusing instead on overall revenue growth. Regional ARPU varies significantly, with North America at $17.26/month in Q4 2024 and EMEA at $10.87/month in 2023.",

The company reported a pretax profit margin of 11.6%, which was above the high-end of its plan by 0.7 percentage points (70 bps).

    "question": "Does Workday (NASDAQ: WDAY) report a gross or net retention metric in its annual or quarterly reporting? If so, provide the definition",
    "answer": "FINAL ANSWER: Yes, Workday (WDAY) reports BOTH gross retention and net retention metrics.\n\nGross Revenue Retention (GRR) Definition:\nWorkday's Gross Revenue Retention Rate measures the percentage of recurring revenue retained from existing customers. It is calculated by taking total Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) of customers as of the corresponding prior period-end and comparing that to ARR from that same set of customers as of the current period-end. The metric takes into account recurring revenues lost to product or customer churn but does NOT account for additional revenue earned from add-ons or net expansions (which include volume and price adjustments).\n\nPer Workday's Financial Analyst Day (September 2022): \"Calculated by measuring the annual recurring revenue of our customers for the year-earlier period that we have maintained in the current period, without giving credit for additional upsells and/or seat related changes. The metric captures only customer and product churn.\"\n\nARR Calculation: ARR represents the annualized value of active subscription contracts as of the end of each period. Each subscription contract is annualized by dividing the total contract value by the number of days in the contract term and then multiplying by 365.\n\nReported Metrics:\n- Workday's Gross Revenue Retention: ~95% (industry-leading)\n- Workday's Net Dollar Retention (NDR): 100%\n\nNote: Public reporting of gross retention is uncommon - an Ordway study found only 9 of 140 SaaS companies disclosed gross retention versus over 70 that reported net retention.",
