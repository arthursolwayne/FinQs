    "question": "How has Netflix's (NASDAQ: NFLX) Average Revenue Per Paying User Changed from 2019 to 2024?",
    "answer": "FINAL ANSWER: Netflix's global Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), which Netflix calls ARM (Average Revenue per Membership), changed as follows from 2019 to 2024:\n\n2019: ~$10.82 per month\n2020: ~$10.91 per month (+ $0.09 or +0.8% YoY)\n2021: ~$11.67-11.76 per month (estimated, +7-8% YoY)\n2022: ~$11.67-11.76 per month (estimated, relatively flat)\n2023: $11.64 per month (relatively flat)\n2024: $11.70 per month (+ $0.06 or +0.5% YoY)\n\nOverall Trend: Netflix's ARPU increased approximately 8% from 2019 to 2024 (from $10.82 to $11.70), with the most significant growth occurring between 2020 and 2021 (likely driven by pandemic demand and price increases). From 2021-2024, ARPU remained relatively stable in the $11.64-$11.76 range. \n\nNote: Netflix announced in 2024 that it would stop regularly reporting ARM as a standalone metric, focusing instead on overall revenue growth. Regional ARPU varies significantly, with North America at $17.26/month in Q4 2024 and EMEA at $10.87/month in 2023.",

    "question": "Does Workday (NASDAQ: WDAY) report a gross or net retention metric in its annual or quarterly reporting? If so, provide the definition",
    "answer": "FINAL ANSWER: Yes, Workday (WDAY) reports BOTH gross retention and net retention metrics.\n\nGross Revenue Retention (GRR) Definition:\nWorkday's Gross Revenue Retention Rate measures the percentage of recurring revenue retained from existing customers. It is calculated by taking total Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) of customers as of the corresponding prior period-end and comparing that to ARR from that same set of customers as of the current period-end. The metric takes into account recurring revenues lost to product or customer churn but does NOT account for additional revenue earned from add-ons or net expansions (which include volume and price adjustments).\n\nPer Workday's Financial Analyst Day (September 2022): \"Calculated by measuring the annual recurring revenue of our customers for the year-earlier period that we have maintained in the current period, without giving credit for additional upsells and/or seat related changes. The metric captures only customer and product churn.\"\n\nARR Calculation: ARR represents the annualized value of active subscription contracts as of the end of each period. Each subscription contract is annualized by dividing the total contract value by the number of days in the contract term and then multiplying by 365.\n\nReported Metrics:\n- Workday's Gross Revenue Retention: ~95% (industry-leading)\n- Workday's Net Dollar Retention (NDR): 100%\n\nNote: Public reporting of gross retention is uncommon - an Ordway study found only 9 of 140 SaaS companies disclosed gross retention versus over 70 that reported net retention.",

    "answer": "FINAL ANSWER: Uber's 2024 revenue growth of $44.0 billion (+18% vs 2023) was driven by BOTH take-rate expansion and volume growth, with volume growth being the primary driver but take-rate expansion providing significant margin improvement.\n\n**Take-Rate Expansion Contribution:**\n- Overall take rate: 27% in 2024, with expectations to rise to 29% by 2034\n- Mobility Revenue Margin: 30.3% (+160 bps YoY) - significant take-rate expansion\n- Delivery Revenue Margin: 18.7% (+40 bps YoY) - moderate take-rate expansion\n- Advertising revenue surpassed $1.5B annual run rate in Q1 2025 (+60% YoY), after surpassing $1B in 2024\n\n**Volume Growth Drivers:**\n- Mobility Gross Bookings increased due to higher Trip volumes\n- Delivery Gross Bookings increased due to higher Trip volumes  \n- Uber One membership: 30 million members (+60% YoY, +5M in Q4)\n- Cross-selling: 37% of users engaging with multiple products (all-time high)\n\n**Revenue Growth by Segment:**\n- Mobility: +26.5% ($5.26B increase from $19.83B to $25.09B)\n- Delivery: +12.67% ($1.55B increase from $12.20B to $13.75B)\n- Freight: -1.98% ($104M decline)\n\n**Profitability Impact:**\nAdjusted EBITDA grew 44% YoY to $1.8B in Q4, with margin rising to 4.2% from 3.4%, driven by cost leverage from higher volume AND increased advertising revenue (take-rate expansion).\n\nConclusion: While volume growth drove the majority of revenue increase, take-rate expansion (particularly through Uber One, advertising, and pricing optimization) significantly enhanced margins and profitability.",

    "answer": "FINAL ANSWER: Based on the available data from 3D Systems' fiscal year 2023 proxy statement and compensation disclosures, the individual director compensation amounts found include:\n\n- Charles G. McClure, Jr.: $400,000 ($250,000 cash fees + $150,000 stock awards)\n- William E. Curran: $255,000 ($105,000 cash fees + $150,000 stock awards)\n- Jim D. Kever: $220,000 ($70,000 cash fees + $150,000 stock awards)\n- Thomas W. Erickson: $228,764 ($78,764 cash + $150,000 equity)\n\nPartial Total (4 directors): $1,103,764\n\nNote: The search results provided compensation data for 4 non-employee directors. 3D Systems typically has 6-8 board members total. The complete total for all directors in 2023 would be found in the full Director Compensation Table in the DEF 14A proxy statement filed with the SEC. Based on the pattern ($150,000 equity + varying cash fees ranging from $70,000-$250,000 per director), the estimated total director compensation for all non-employee directors in 2023 would likely range from $1.5-2.5 million depending on the number of directors and their committee roles.",

    "question": "What would be the impact to net income in dollars and percent if all debt for Boeing in 2024 were refinanced at 3% higher interest rates than current?",
    "answer": "FINAL ANSWER: If all of Boeing's debt in 2024 were refinanced at 3% higher interest rates, the approximate impact would be:\n\n**Additional Annual Interest Expense**: Approximately $1.62 billion\n- Total debt 2024: $53.86 billion\n- Interest rate increase: 3.0%\n- Calculation: $53.86 billion \u00d7 3% = $1.616 billion\n\n**Impact to Net Income**: -$1.62 billion (reduction)\n\nBoeing reported a net loss of $11.83 billion for fiscal year 2024. An additional $1.62 billion in interest expense would increase this loss to approximately $13.45 billion, representing a 13.7% worsening of the net loss.\n\n**Context from 2024 10-K**:\n- Long-term debt increased from $47.1 billion in 2023 to $52.59 billion in 2024\n- Short-term debt declined from $5.20 billion in 2023 to $1.28 billion in 2024\n- Total debt: $53.86 billion as of December 31, 2024\n- Interest expense showed an increasing trend through 2024",

    "answer": "FINAL ANSWER: Zillow's Free Cash Flow (approximated as Operating Cash Flow minus Capital Expenditures) over the last 3 years:\n\n**2024 (Full Year):**\n- Operating Cash Flow: $428M\n- Capital Expenditures: ~$143M (estimated)\n- Free Cash Flow: $285M\n- FCF Margin: 12.72% (FCF/Revenue of $2.24B)\n\n**2023 (Full Year):**\n- Operating Cash Flow: $354M\n- Free Cash Flow: $219M\n- Revenue: $1.95B\n- FCF Margin: ~11.2%\n\n**2022 (Full Year):**\n- Operating Cash Flow: $4,504M\n- Capital Expenditures: $165M\n- Free Cash Flow: $4,389M\n- Revenue: $1.96B\n- FCF Margin: ~224% (anomaly due to Zillow Offers wind-down)\n\n**Trend Analysis:**\nThe 2022 FCF was artificially inflated due to the one-time wind-down of Zillow Offers, which generated massive cash inflows from inventory liquidation. Excluding this anomaly, the normalized trend from 2023 to 2024 shows healthy improvement:\n- FCF increased from $219M (2023) to $285M (2024), representing ~30% growth\n- FCF margin improved from ~11.2% (2023) to 12.72% (2024)\n- The company successfully transitioned from the 2022 iBuying exit to sustainable, growing cash generation with improving margins in 2023-2024.",

Show your work, including Q1 guidance, historical March growth rates, average growth, and projected implied Q1 revenue.",
    "answer": "FINAL ANSWER: Based on the analysis, TSMC would BEAT its Q1 2025 guidance.\n\n**Q1 2025 Guidance:**\n- Revenue guidance: $28.4 billion to $29.2 billion (midpoint: $28.8 billion)\n- Provided during Q4 2024 earnings call on January 16, 2025\n\n**Historical March Quarter Sequential Growth Patterns:**\n\nBased on TSMC's historical Q1 (March quarter) performance, the company typically experiences sequential decline from Q4 to Q1 due to seasonality:\n\n- Q1 2024: Revenue decreased 3.8% from Q4 2023\n- Q1 2023: Revenue decreased 18.7% from Q4 2022\n- Q1 2022: Positive sequential growth (exceeded Q4 2021)\n- Q1 2021: Revenue increased 0.2% from Q4 2020\n- Q1 2020: Revenue decreased 2.1% from Q4 2019\n\n**Analysis:**\nTSMC's Q1 is typically the weakest quarter, averaging 22.2% of annual revenue. The company noted that Q1 business typically \"declined less than seasonality due to increase in HPC-related demand\" but is \"impacted by smartphone seasonality.\"\n\n**Actual Q1 2025 Results:**\nTSMC reported Q1 2025 revenue of $25.53 billion (or $25.5 billion in some sources), representing:\n- 42% increase year-over-year\n- 5.1% decrease sequentially from Q4 2024\n\nThe actual Q1 2025 revenue of $25.5 billion fell SHORT of the guidance range of $28.4-$29.2 billion.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the actual reported results, TSMC MISSED its Q1 2025 guidance by approximately $2.9 billion to $3.7 billion (10-13% below guidance). The revenue was \"slightly above the midpoint of their guidance\" according to some sources, but the actual figure of $25.5B is significantly below the stated guidance of $28.4-29.2B, suggesting there may be inconsistency in the reported data or the guidance was subsequently revised.",
